# RedHatCookies
A guide to create your own Red Hat cookie

Cookie cutter
-------------
First, you'll need a cookie cutter. Just download the 3D print template here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4682723 and print it with your 3D printer or let it print by one of the many 3D print services on the internet.

The dough
---------
This dough will be enough for ~100 cookies:

* 500gr flour
* 250gr butter
* 150gr sugar
* 1/2 spoon baking powder
* 1 pinch of salt
* 1 pckg vanilla sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 drops butter-vanilla-flavour

Simply mix all ingredients together and put the dough into the fridge for an hour.
Then roll it out (don't use the whole dough at once, 1/4 at a time is better) and use the cookie cutter to cut out the hats.

Now preheat the oven to 170Â°C and lay the hat cookies on a baking tray for 15-20 minutes.

Coloring
--------
Now that the cookies are ready, they will need some coloring - red for the hat and white for the hatband, e.g.

Prepare sugar icing by adding 2 spoons of water and some red food color to ~100gr powdered sugar and stir it thouroughly. Use a brush to paint the hat cookies red.

After the red sugar icing has dryed, same procedure with half or a third the amount of powdered sugar and water without food color for the white hatband; use an injection or pipette to get a fine line onto the hat.

Enjoy!
